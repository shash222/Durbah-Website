This source code serves to provide a way to connect with students of Qabeelat Durbah. It
attempts to provide a medium that allows students to learn more about the Qabeelat and 
Al Maghrib Institute by displaying information about upcoming seminars, volunteering, 
scholarship and financial aid, and insha'Allah will provide a means to engage more
actively with students by providing exam resources, and perhaps a forum through which
students can ask questions that can be answered by our esteemed shuyookh and knowledgeable
students.

This website was built using the React JavaScript Framework and npm package manager.
